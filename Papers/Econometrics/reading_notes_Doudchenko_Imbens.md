# Doudchenko and Imbens (2016)


## Things I don't understand

- The benefit of having few strictly positive weights.
- Why it's not reasonable to rescale covariates
- Why it's not reasonable to have an intercept, with or without rescaled covariates.
    - I think I get the argument that without rescaling, there's no reason to think that the difference is some constant, but that seems maybe better than having no mu.  (Put differently, setting mu=0 is still a choice, as much as mu not equal to zero.)

## Controls?

Their discussion of controls feels unsatisfying.
