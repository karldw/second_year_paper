# Things to talk about with Jim:

# Second Year Paper / GSR RIP
## Modeling questions
- I'd like to tell a story about supply and demand for used vehicles in the face of an anticipated income shock.
    - Is that story interesting?  (It feels very IO/macro to me, which is okay, but not my main focus)
    - Would it be more interesting to look at changes in the types/efficiency of vehicles being sold?
- If I run my regression as an event study DD with buyer and day FE, would you believe it?
- If calculate the sale_date FE, can I use the point estimates to look at patterns in anticipation?
    - How can I think more formally about anticipation in the wholesale market?
- In the Manheim data, how much can I count on the buyer_id being correct and consistent over time?
- When I'm looking at buyers daily totals/counts, none buy every day. Most buy only a small fraction of the time. Should I add zeros for buyers who don't trade?


## Presentation questions
- I'd like to maximize the usefulness of Monday's presentation. What kinds of things should I ask for help with?
