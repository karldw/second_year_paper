                \item  For \msrp{} the conclusions are dramatically different for levels and logs.
                    For levels, the estimated effects are insignificant, and the confidence intervals rule out large effects -- anything larger than 10 or 20\% of the mean.

                    With point estimates around 0.35 and confidence interval upper bounds around 0.7 (for reasonable specifications; not those starting at the beginning), we can't reject large effects.
                    At the same time, the lower bound of the CIs is \emph{just} above zero, so I don't want to put too much stock in the statistical significance shown in the plot.

                \item  As with \textsc{msrp}, there's a difference between logs and levels here.  With levels, the results are insignificant, the point estimates are very close to zero and we can reject most results above 15\% of the mean price.  (The mean is \$14,912.13.)

\section{Introduction}

Automobile sales make up a large portion of the US economy, are some of the largest purchases consumers make and generate significant externalities.
For these reasons, we should be interested in what factors drive automobile purchases and consumer choices.
Since vehicles are substantial investments, it's natural to expect income effects -- if a consumer's budget constraint is relaxed (exogenously and without anticipation), their purchase decisions should change.
The  Alaska Permanent Fund provides an interesting source of income variation, allowing me to look at a few aspects of the income effect in car purchases.

The Alaska Permanent Fund is an account set up to hold and invest a portion of the state's mineral rights revenue.
These dividends are substantial, roughly \$1000--2000 per person, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:permanent-fund-payments-individual}.
The dividend amount is not contingent on age or income, so a large family may receive more than \$10,000.
Since the 1980s, the fund has been sending dividend payments in the fourth quarter of each year to Alaskan residents \parencite{hsieh2003}.
In recent years, the payment has happened on the first Thursday in October.
I will use this somewhat-arbitrary payment date as a source of variation in household's income, and therefore willingness to buy vehicles.

\begin{figure}[bht]
    \caption{\large Alaska Permanent Fund payments per person}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{permanent_fund_payments_individual_notitle.pdf}

		Figures are adjusted for inflation using the annual average \textsc{cpi} \parencite{fred_inflation}.
		The 2008 total includes a one-time, \$1200 bonus.
\end{figure}

It's worth mentioning a few of the dividend details before going on.
The dividend is paid out of investment earnings -- 10.5\% of the past five years' earnings -- not out of present-day oil revenue.
The Permanent Fund investments are made in a broad variety of stocks and bonds, and the dividend amount is very predictable.
\footnote{The asset allocation is detailed in the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation's website, \url{http://apfc.org/home/Content/investments/assetAllocation2009.cfm}}
The dividend amount is finalized and announced a few weeks before payment, and Alaskan newspapers publish accurate predictions before that \parencite{adn_dividend_prediction, adn_dividend_realization}.

The dividend the same amount for all recipients, with no means testing or other adjustments.
Almost everyone in Alaska gets the dividend.
Major exceptions are people who have lived in the state for less than a year and people serving time for some crimes.
Approximately 91\% of the state's population applies and about 95\% of those applications are granted.


The principal data source in my analysis is the Manheim wholesale used vehicle auction data.
The dataset records sale prices, vehicle identifiers, buyer and seller IDs and locations.
After various cleaning measures, described in section~\ref{sec:manheim-data-cleaning}, I have
\snippet{auctions_cleaned_total_obs_count.tex}
observations of vehicle sales.
These sales are between wholesalers such as auto dealerships, rental car agencies and vehicle leasing programs.
In the following analysis, I focus on wholesalers with billing zip codes in Alaska who buy vehicles in the auctions, and for simiplicity, I call all wholesalers ``dealers.''

There are no auction sites in Alaska, so all of the purchases I observe for these dealers are from out of state.
While I see when the vehicles were bought at auction, I don't know when they were delivered.
Presumably, there can be some substantial delay shipping to Alaska; I examine the delay and anticipation effects as part of my analysis.

Importantly, I don't observe final sales to customers, so I don't know the timing or their purchases or the prices they are charged.
I assume that cars bought by Alaskan dealers are sold to consumers with a not-to-long delay, since it's costly to hold unsold cars on the lot.
(I exclude cars that are bought and resold within a year.)
These are \emph{used} vehicles only, so I will only be able to discuss the market for new vehicles in my theoretical speculation (section~\ref{sec:model}).
% The Manheim data are described in more detail in section~\ref{sec:manheim-data}.


% \subsection{Literature}
I mentioned that a large, \emph{unanticipated} income shock may have substantial effects.
The permanent income hypothesis literature emphasizes the importance of anticipation.
Since the payment timing and amount is not a surprise, the strong forms of the permanent income hypothesis would predict no response at all.
The permanent income hypothesis would also predict an increase in consumption when the payment is announced, but because the dividend date has been well known many years, I'm not able to examine the consumption decisions around a specific announcement date.
In the real world, liquidity constraints, uncertainty and behavioral factors may mean that people don't smooth their consumption perfectly.

The previous paper analyzing the Alaska Permanent Fund dividends, \textcite{hsieh2003}, used the consumer expenditure survey to look at changes in consumption from the third quarter to the fourth.
Hsieh, a macroeconomist, didn't reject the consumption smoothing hypothesis, though his identifying variation relied on potentially\hyp{}endogenous differences in family size and year-to-year dividend variation.

In addition to consumption smoothing, we may be interested in durable goods purchases because those goods determine energy use.
Various authors \textbf{WHO?} have argued that consumers undervalue fuel efficiency.
It's possible that having more cash on hand would lead a consumer to make a longer-sighted decision and include the full value of fuel efficiency savings.

\begin{itemize}
    \item PIH
    \item Fuel efficiency choice
    \item IO of used auto markets
\end{itemize}

\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

% TODO First explain in words, then make formal in math.  Figure out good, non-conflicting syntax.

\subsection{Consumers}


People have preferences for vehicle traits and vehicle ownership, but are constrained by their budgets.
They can therefore change what they buy when they have a check from the government.
% TODO: pull out one of the basic macro models of buffer-stock saving or something like it
Even though the check is anticipated, they don't fully smooth because they don't build up enough savings in the course of their normal consumption path.

There are also behavioral possibilities, both in lack of smoothing and people treating dividend checks differently than they would treat their own savings.
I won't really be able to disentangle these, since I don't have any situations where saved wealth is exogenously manipulated, but it's important to consider that responses may differ between this situation and others.

\subsection{Auto dealers}

Economic intuition says that car dealers would not be thrilled to hold onto vehicles for longer than necessary, if only because of the opportunity cost of capital.
For instance, US News offers the advice, ``If the car has been there for more than three months, the dealer will be more anxious to sell it as quickly as possible''
\parencite{usnews_car_deals}.

To make the model less complex, I'll assume auto-dealers don't exercise market power when they buy or sell their used cars, that they have a deep understanding of consumers' preferences, and that it's costly to hold inventory.

Assuming consumers buy more used cars upon receiving their dividend checks, dealers adjust.
Specifically, the dealers know what kinds of cars will be popular and will buy these beforehand, making sure they're available when the dividends arrive.

It's also possible the dividend checks influence \emph{new} car purchases.
I don't have data on these.
%TODO: should I model the unobserved new car purchases as well, having dealers maximize over both new and used sales?

Assuming away market power is clearly a big assumption, but Alaska is a small part of the overall used car market, and making it unlikely that individual Alaskan buyers act as monopsonists in the auction market.


% TODO: any justification? What would the implications be if they had monopoly power in selling to consumers or monopsony power in buying in auctions.
% TODO: how are the auctions designed? Sealed bid? English? Some of them have reserves...

% TODO: Another story I could tell is one of price effects.  If Alaskan dealers pay more for the same VIN10 in years with high dividends, we might think there's something going on.
% To get that right, it's important to control for vehicle quality carefully; a higher price could indicate market shifts, or just that Alaskan dealers are shifting to newer used cars.
% (Both are interesting, but they're different stories.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item MSRP (not inflation adjusted)
    \item Fuel economy -- I take combined (city and highway) miles per gallon and convert to liters per 100~km.
    I do this because fuel consumption is generally much better behaved than fuel efficiency; the reciprocal can lead to unintuitive or poorly behaved estimates.
    Rather than simply taking the reciprocal and having gallons per mile, I convert to liters per 100~km because no one uses gallons per mile, while liters per 100~km is at least interpretable by people who have lived outside the US\@.

\section[DD Results]{Difference-in-Differences Results}

The auction data have before- and after-dividend data for treated and untreated states, so a difference\hyp{}in\hyp{}differences framework is a natural framing.
Alaska is different from many other states, so picking appropriate controls is an important and somewhat subjective endeavor.
Below, in section~\ref{sec:picking-controls} I discuss how I've chosen the current set of controls: Utah, Idaho and Montana.
In section~\ref{sec:synthetic-controls} I discuss next steps to formalize the selection of control states.

For the difference\hyp{}in\hyp{}differences analysis, I've chosen a default window of 70~days (10~weeks) before and after the early-October dividend.
This fairly wide window allows for various anticipation or delayed effects without getting too close to the end of the year and the associated sales slowdown.


\subsection{Picking control states}
\label{sec:picking-controls}
In considering which states are good controls for Alaska, it's worth diving a little more into the structure of the Manheim auction data.
Auctions occur in 32 states and Puerto Rico, and Alaska is not among them.
Therefore all purchases by Alaskan buyers are at out-of-state auctions.
For the simple difference\hyp{}in\hyp{}differences below, I've chosen Idaho, Oregon and Utah.
The choice is somewhat subjective -- I chose these states because they have a large fraction of their out-of-state purchases in the auction states where Alaskan dealers are buying.
This heuristic is appealing because it captures the markets where Alaska is operating, as well as additional factors, such as transportation costs, that arise from dealers buying their vehicles out of state.
% See the code in find_match_states_crude_unmemoized for full details..
A more robust approach is to use best-subset or synthetic controls methods described in \textcite{DoudchenkoImbens2016DD} and section~\ref{sec:synthetic-controls}, and I plan to implement these in a future iteration of this project.

\begin{figure}[bth]
	\caption{Alaska-only and pooled mean and standard deviations}
	\label{fig:alaska_vs_pooled_mean_sd}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{comparison_alaska_vs_pooled_mean_sd.pdf}
\end{figure}

In addition to worrying about the control group for difference\hyp{}in\hyp{}differences, one might also worry about the effect size measurements.
In some of the analyses below, I divide by the sample mean or standard deviation to look at the size of the estimated coefficient.
Figure~\ref{fig:alaska_vs_pooled_mean_sd} plots out the mean and standard deviation I use for these normalizations.
Using the event window sample (70 days before to 70 days after the dividend) is almost identical to the full-year sample, but Alaska is a smaller market than the controls I've chosen.
Alaska has a lower mean and standard deviation in cars sold, and therefore the total value of sales.
As well, the cars sold in Alaska are a bit more expensive and a bit less efficient.
It's worth keeping these differences in mind in the outcomes below.
The log specifications adjust for percentage differences more directly.

\subsection{Picking an anticipation window}

As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:model}, we might expect consumers to sharply change their consumption when they receive the dividend checks.
Auto dealers would anticipate that behavior and change their auction purchases somewhat earlier, depending on transportation time and the costs of holding inventory.

On the other hand, dealers anecdotally say they just try to maintain their inventories.
While the dealers know that customers tend to  buy more cars around the dividend date and when they receive tax refunds, but the dealers report that don't make additional efforts to stock up before the dividend is sent.
In this case, the auction data should show no anticipation effect.
Instead, there should be some increase in auction sales after the dividend, as customers buy cars and deplete dealers' inventories, which the dealers then restock.

Anecdata are often wrong, so maybe it's worth considering the theoretical predicting a dealer anticipation effect.
Theory doesn't tell us, however, how long that anticipation window should be.
To be as flexible as possible, I have estimated the results for varying windows from one to nine weeks of anticipation, as shown in figures~\ref{fig:anticipation_window_sale_count} and~\ref{fig:anticipation_window_sale_tot}.
In all cases, the anticipation window ends the immediately before the dividend day.

None of the estimates are statistically significant, and they are all far below the standard deviation of weekly sales counts and sales totals, as indicated by the horizontal lines at the top of the graphs.
(Different states have somewhat different standard deviations, the pooled standard deviation is not driven by states with particularly large variation.
The 95\% confidence interval of the anticipation estimates less than are standard deviation for Alaska and every control state, as demonstrated in figure~\ref{bonusfig:anticipation_window_sale_count_and_tot_weekly_states_sd}.)
I default to calculating the pooled standard deviation across Alaska and the control states and across all weeks in the data.
Calculating the standard deviation on only periods within the event window -- from 70~days before the dividend is sent to 70~days after -- gives slightly larger standard deviations, and therefore even smaller effect sizes.
(See figure~\ref{fig:alaska_vs_pooled_mean_sd}.)

Using daily data produces similar results.
The coefficients are somewhat more variable and a couple are statistically significant, but they're still much smaller than the standard deviation.

On the other hand, one might put more credence in the anecdotes.
To show that there is still no effect on vehicle sales, I'll estimate an even more flexible treatment window.

\subsection{Volume of cars sold}
% TODO: move this section up so I can talk about number and volumes of cars sold
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:cars_sold_with_anticipation}
    \text{Cars sold} = & \ \beta_1 \ \text{anticipation} + \beta_2 \ \text{Alaska} \times \text{anticipation} + \beta_3 \ \text{post-dividend} \\ \nonumber
    &+ \beta_4 \ \text{Alaska} \times \text{post-dividend} + \text{state and year fixed effects}
    %\\

    % &+ \gamma_4 \ \text{Alaska} \times \text{post-dividend} + \text{state and year fixed effects}
\end{align}

% Collapse data to a state-by-day panel and run DD regs of sale count per capita and sale volume per capita.
% Use all years, use event time relative to the dividend day and don't take into account any anticipation.
% Control for either a year FE or state \gdp{}. Control for either daily or day-of-week FE.
% As a default, the cars sold in the set of states where Alaskan buyers are active (in a given year).
% Force the panel to be balanced by adding zeros (if necessary).

This is theoretically ambiguous -- sales of \emph{used} cars could go up or down with an income shock, or be unchanged.

\end{figure}


In addition to the number of cars sold, we could look at total sales volume in dollars.
I find the component pieces -- the number of cars and the price of each -- more interesting, so I won't linger on the total sales volume analysis.
As with sales count, the effects are quite small when estimated in levels, with wider confidence intervals when estimated in logs.

    Sign is the sign of the coefficient estimate, and because confidence intervals are symmetric, the sign of the larger bound of the 95\% confidence interval.
    }
\end{figure}


For \msrp{} the conclusions are dramatically different for levels and logs.
    For levels, the estimated effects are insignificant, and the confidence intervals rule out large effects -- anything larger than 10 or 20\% of the mean.

    For logs, the point estimates and confidence intervals allow for much larger results.
    With point estimates around 0.35 and confidence interval upper bounds around 0.7 (for reasonable specifications; not those starting at the beginning), we can't reject large effects.
    At the same time, the lower bound of the CIs is \emph{just} above zero, so I don't want to put too much stock in the statistical significance shown in the plot.
    %

\subsection{Efficiency of cars sold}
% Repeat the previous, but with the average \gpm{} of vehicles sold.

Why look at efficiency?
Some people have speculated that there's an energy efficiency gap, where people are failing to appreciate the energy efficiency implications of their purchases.

Overall, not a large effect. We can rule out any effect larger than about 10\% of the mean, and the coefficients aren't statistically significant.

\section{Extensions}

\subsection{Synthetic controls}
\label{sec:synthetic-controls}
Do the previous DD section again, but with synthetic controls or, maybe, the fancier frameworks of
\textcite{DoudchenkoImbens2016DD} or \textcite{Xu2016}

\subsection{Standard errors}
% Elaborate:
The standard errors are only robust to heteroskedasticity, not any form of autocorrelation.
I haven't clustered because I don't have enough clusters for the asymptotics to be valid.

\subsection{Other measures of vehicle quality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Age
    \item Depreciated value
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consumer side}
\subsubsection{Quarterly Polk data}
% TODO: run a regression with Hsieh-style quarter-over-quarter registration counts
\subsubsection{Other registration data}

\subsection{Robustness}
Not all years are the same.
A natural robustness check is to exclude one year at a time and see if the results change dramatically.




\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Generally, not huge effects.
    \item Mention the outcomes specifically.
    \item Why would that be?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Possible that people aren't responding in a dramatic way
        \item Possible that consumers \emph{are} responding dramatically, but the shifts are absorbed in inventory, which the dealers gradually replenish.
