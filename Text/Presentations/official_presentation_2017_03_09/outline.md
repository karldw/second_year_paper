# Outline for March 9, 2017

## Alaska details
- Be clear, this is an income discontinuity, but not a surprise
- Mention Hsieh (2003)

## Auctions details

## My DD setup
- Collapse to state-by-week observations
    - This is natural for sales counts, maybe less natural for vehicle efficiency
- Acknowledge weaknesses:
    - Somewhat arbitrary controls
    - Flawed standard errors
    - Some estimates are noisy, should try adding regressors to soak up variation

## Results
- Tight estimates for sales counts, noisier for other things
