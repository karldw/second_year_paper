## Feedback
- Read the paper Scott sent
- How many dealers are buying cars?
- Where are the dealers buying cars?
- Theory: why would people not be smoothing? Am I going with a credit constraint story?
- Theory: would people ever pay more for a long-lasting durable good? Why not just wait a few months?
- The money going into the PFD is intimately related to the Alaskan economy; think carefully about whether that tangles up my interpretation
- Are there any safeways in Alaska? (yes) Costcos? (yes) (Gabe wants a story where people buy bulk consumer products)
- How big are the counties? (bigish, but there are 29, so it's probably not terrible) Is it at all reasonable to talk about county-level data?
- Talk to Francis about getting health care data
- Figure out how many hospitals are in Alaska and consider calling them for data
- For the cars regression, run a version exactly like Hsieh: LHS is q4/q3 (or log thereof)
- Write out more of the model for supply and demand of cars.
- If there were demand shocks, would that be useful variation to identify supply and demand curves? How about extreme weather?
- When exactly does the announcement happen?
- What newspapers publish the results?  When?  How accurate are they?
- If the newspapers are ever off their estimates, do we see people updating?
- Be explicit about the assumptions necessary for Hsieh's version and for my DD version.
- Find out more about MEPS

### Question:
Is there any traction with people who have kids born just before the cutoff vs those born just after?
