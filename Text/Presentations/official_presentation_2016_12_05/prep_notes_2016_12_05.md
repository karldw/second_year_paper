### Inventories
Economists have been thinking about inventories for a long time.
Maybe this isn't the most productive area for me to work on, but I just want to acknowledge that there are models out there for manufacturers holding inventory.

A few examples:
- Lovell (1961) *Econometrica*
- Feldstein and Aurerbach (1976) *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity*
- Cachon and Olivares (2010) *Management Science*  -- this one is actually about cars
