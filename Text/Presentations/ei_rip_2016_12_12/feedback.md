## Emails to send
- Ask Raphson and Muelleger for the slides on tax cuts they presented at camp.
- Sophia on Safeway

## Other questions
- Can I look at an income/substitution effect for efficiency with gas prices and the check
- If I throw in enough controls, maybe I can do a dose-response with payment amount (Severin says)
- Model of adverse selection with car loans -- when you get the check, you have more money to meet a downpayment, but are not necessarily more creditworthy.
- Alcohol consumption and death
- Can I use the CPS to get a better sample with number of people in HH and income? (but then, how can I look at outcomes?)
- Do housing markets respond? People are definitely credit constrained there.
- Do car dealers run more adds with the refund?

## Data to get
- Safeway Alaska (and Safeway Canada?)
    - Particularly Alcohol sales
- State-specific CPI?
- Retail gas prices?
- Family size, births and consumption
- Vehicle accident (fatal accident data are definitely available, all accident data might be)
- Auto dealer loan terms?
- Housing?


## Presentation notes
- Have an estimating equation
- Don't dive into the data so much first.
