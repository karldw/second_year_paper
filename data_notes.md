## National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS and NHAMCS)
Not usable. The data are physician-patient encounters (which seems great), but don't have the geographic coverage I need.
Pre-2012, sampling was only valid in four sub-national regions.
Post-2012, the 34 most populus states can be identified. ()

##  National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS)
No good, just combining NHAMCS with data I don't need.

## National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS)
No good, just a new name for NHDS.

## National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
No expenditure data.

## Medicare / Medicaid (CMS)
Only annual data are available before 2015. The data are expensive and limited-use.
